# Algorithms-and-Computability
Repository for Algorithms and Computability project.

 This is a console application for finding a Maximum Common Subgraph and Minimum Common Supergraph for any given 2 input graphs. \
Directory structure of the solution:
- *Doc* - documentation with description of the problem and used algorithms
- *Examples* - directory containing examples of input graphs, represented by adjacency matrices, saved in .txt files (naming convention and required format of file contents can be found in the documentation)
- *EXE* - single executable file for running the application
- *Source* - directory with source code
